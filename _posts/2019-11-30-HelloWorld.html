<p>Hello World! Welcome to my first blog post! In this blog I hope to document my progress of my different projects I undertake as well as life events I experience.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">First Documented Project</h2>

<p>This page! This is the first project I am documenting. I created this site using Jekyll with the "clean blog" theme, which has been surprisingly easy and fun to do. First I went <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"> Jekyll's Homepage</a> and followed their tutorial on how to create a basic site with multiple pages. After that tutorial I found the "Clean Blog" Theme <a href="https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll">Here</a> and followed their guide on how to use their theme. Overall it was a fun little Saturday morning project.</p>
