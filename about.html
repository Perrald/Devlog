<p>I am a Software Developer who likes to toy around with new projects and languages.</p>

<p>The Purpose of this site is for me to document my tinkerings and hopefully others can learn from my mistakes made along the way. My current projects include this site amde with Jekyll and a mobile video game made with Unity.</p>

<p class="mb-5">If you have any suggestions or ideas on things I should tinker with let me know from the Contacts page</p>
